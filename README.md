**AskNavidrome** is an Alexa skill which allows you to play music hosted on a SubSonic API compatible media server, like Navidrome.

You can stream your own music collection to your Echo devices without the restrictions you would normally face with regular 
streaming services like Amazon Music or Spotify.  AskNavidrome allows you to:

- Skip backwards and forwards in your current queue or playlist without limitation.
- Avoid paying subscription costs.
- Avoid being forced to listen to adverts at regular intervals.
- Actually use the music collection you have already paid for!
- Run the service on a PC directly or inside a Docker container.
